ud-demo
=======

A sample app playing with the Github API, used during my talk at UD-ACM's dev workshop on Oct. 23, 2014. This talk is will have been targeted at people very new to Android, with the idea that I will walk through the process of making a simple app using remote APIs from the first default Activity Android Studio hands you.


How To Use This
=======
If you've never picked up an IDE before, here's what you're going to want to do:

1. Clone This Repo
2. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html)
3. Use the SDK Manager from Android Studio in the Toolbar to install SDK 21, Build Tools 21.0.1, the latest SDK Tools and Platform-Tools, the Android Support Library and Android Support Repository, and honestly basically anything else it suggests.
4. Use Import Project from Android Studio to import your cloned repo.
5. If you have an Android device in [developer mode](http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html) you can now hook up by USB and try out the app. If not, you're going to need to [use an emulator](https://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html) which I honestly don't recommend.
